## Blazor.WebAudio

**FROM Blazor.WebAudio**
A Blazor wrapper for the [Web Audio browser API.](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/)
This Web API standardizes methods for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering. This project implements a wrapper around the API for Blazor so that we can easily and safely work with audio in the browser.

**This wrapper is still being developed so ideas are still being tested and experimented with.**
